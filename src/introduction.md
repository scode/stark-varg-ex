# Stark Varg EX - Unofficial Owner's Guide

Information intended to be useful to Stark Varg EX owners that is a combination of experience, asking around, trolling
online material etc.

This is an **unofficial** guide. Always verify information against official Stark documentation.

This should be considered a companion to the manual. It is not complete. It focuses on information that either (a) does
not appear in the manual and took effort to find, or (b) appears in the manual or official documentation but I want more
accessible (especially when on a phone while working on your bike).
