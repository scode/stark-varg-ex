# Before you buy

## Titanium bolt kit

The bolt kit is marketed mostly around lower weight. But it does have other implications.

The owner's manual says to use the same torque specs, but to check the torque after every ride. I personally suspecxt
this is at least partially just legal cover-your-ass language, but it seems that use of titanum may have real
implications on keeping bolts torqued, lubrication needs, etc..

I recommend taking a look at this
[Claude research report on the implications on torque specs and checking bolts](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/7d1008bd-f204-4711-acd2-85de98d16593)
before making a decision (as always with an LLM generated research report, do not assume all information is accurate).
It's unclear to me how much of the caveats are practically relevant for the Stark Varg Ex. I am offering this as a
heads-up for a topic to potentially research, and am not endorsing the contents of the report.

(I personally opted NOT to choose the titanium kit, except I got it anyway after I was told that otherwise I'd wait 2-3
months to get the bike.)
