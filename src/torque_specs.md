# Stark Varg EX Torque Specifications (UNOFFICIAL)

NOTE: This information may have errors. Always ensure torque specs are correct as per your bikes manual. This is
intended to be a more convenient form of the information but is not a substitute for checking your manual.

## Torque settings NOT found in manual

### Handlebar clamps

Stark refuses to give guidance here via support (as of December 2025). I am still experimenting, but with the Titanium
bolt kit I have used 15 Nm, no locktite, _and frequently inspect them_. This is NOT a recommendation and I believe it is
too little and/or loctite is needed.
